**About me**
Hi, I'm Taro Okamoto.  
I'm studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and want to do web development.  
I'm in the process of making my own website to integrate all the smaller portofolios I have been creating.  
I used to be an English teacher, and used Excel VBA a lot to make English learning tools. That drove me to get into the field of web development, and now I'm seeking to be a web developer!  

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development, and Excel VBA!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also plan to learn about back-end side of programming too.
