### **About me**
  Greetings, I am Taro Okamoto. My current academic endeavor encompasses the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an ultimate ambition to excel in web development. Currently, I am in the throes of constructing a personal website that amalgamates my various smaller portfolios, a testament to my developing skills. Previously, I ventured into the domain of English pedagogy, where I extensively utilized Excel VBA to craft innovative English learning tools. This experience kindled my interest in web development, steering me towards a professional pursuit in this field.  
  
  Initially, my foray into the world of technology was akin to navigating uncharted waters; my knowledge in programming was virtually non-existent, and even basic computer operations, such as using Excel's sum function, were foreign concepts to me. Tasks as mundane as creating tables in Word or PowerPoint could consume hours of my time.  
  
  During my tenure at Hiroshima University, I delved into the study of English and English education. My academic journey was marked by a profound focus on linguistics, where I immersed myself in the nuances of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, thereby enriching my understanding of the English language from a linguistic standpoint. In particular, I engaged in rigorous analysis of English grammar from a prescriptive viewpoint, often debating topics such as the meticulous distinction between "who" and "whom" or the appropriateness of using "was" in subjunctive mood constructions.  
  
  Furthermore, I pursued an in-depth exploration of the etymology of English words. While this intersects with morphology, it often led me down intriguing paths; for instance, the word root "sist," while not a standalone word, manifests in verbs like "insist," "subsist," and "resist." This suffix, hinting at meanings akin to 'stay,' combines with prefixes like "in," "sub," and "re" to form words with distinct meaningsâ€”a fascinating area of study that captured much of my attention.  
  
  My proclivity for the arts and humanities meant that I harbored a longstanding aversion to scientific subjects. The notion of me dabbling in programming was as far-fetched as a fish climbing a tree. Mathematics was particularly daunting, with calculations proving to be my Achilles' heel. Abstract concepts in vector analysis, calculus, trigonometry, and sequences often left me bewildered, leading to bitter experiences in examinations. In the realm of science, I shied away from physics and chemistry, instead opting to study biology.  
  
  It was through developing English learning materials using Excel VBA that I stumbled upon the fascinating world of programming. Initially a task of necessity, it gradually morphed into a passion. I realized that mastering the basics of programming did not require the convoluted thought processes often associated with mathematics and science, instilling in me a newfound confidence.  
  
  The journey was not without its trials and tribulations; envisioning a desired functionality, researching the necessary logic and functions on Google, and then experiencing the grueling process of debugging. However, the euphoria akin to ecstasy upon achieving the intended result was what propelled me further down the path of programming.  
  
  Now, I have transitioned from VBA to focusing on web-centric languages. My development experience has evolved from Vanilla JavaScript to using frameworks like React, Vue.js, and React Native. I've also ventured into backend development, dabbling in PHP for basic websites and exploring web application development with Laravel. My foray into WordPress development using PHP is another testament to my expanding skill set.  
  
  Given the colossal amount of unknowns in this field, I frequently turn to tools like ChatGPT and Google for guidance. These resources have become indispensable to my daily life, almost as vital as air itself.  
  
  Residing in the rural heartlands of Japan, I take pleasure in exploring the quaint villages dotting the countryside. Documenting these adventures is a hobby of mine, and I aspire to one day showcase these explorations on a website, sharing the hidden charms of rural Japan with the world.
