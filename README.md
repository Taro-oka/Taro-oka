Greetings, I am Taro Okamoto. My current academic endeavor encompasses the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an ultimate ambition to excel in web development. Currently, I am in the throes of constructing a personal website that amalgamates my various smaller portfolios, a testament to my developing skills. Previously, I ventured into the domain of English pedagogy, where I extensively utilized Excel VBA to craft innovative English learning tools. This experience kindled my interest in web development, steering me towards a professional pursuit in this field.
